# Highlights

Highlights is a mobile app to easily store quotes taken directly from physical books. The user can input the text manually or choosing a way to upload an image (camera or gallery) to let the app recognize the text.

Built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) 💙 and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/?hl=es) 🔥 Open Source 🤝 Feel free to collaborate.

## Getting Started

This project depends on version **2.0.4** of Flutter. But of course, any stable version in the future should work fine.

Clone the repo and run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies. Then, use `flutter run` to run the app and `flutter test` to run the tests.
